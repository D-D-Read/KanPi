# Hardware for KanPi

## Overview

This section of the repository is a collection of the hardware related files, resources and findings for the KanPi project.
Where possible it will contain editable source files for 3D files, custom board layouts etc.

## Circuit Design

The circuit is designed using [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/), an open source software tool to visualise breadboard-style circuits through to the wiring diagrams and Gerber-style circuit fab ready design files to get your own circuit boards made. 

### Fritzing

This hardware design uses a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/), to show this in the Fritzing tool you will need to install a custom Raspberry Pico part into Fritzing, the one used in this solution can be downloaded [here](https://forum.fritzing.org/uploads/short-url/hHiTYgzUUh6gwIxvtUzKyb9aSr5.fzpz) as part of this [forum post](https://forum.fritzing.org/t/looking-for-raspberry-pi-pico-part/11915/18).
